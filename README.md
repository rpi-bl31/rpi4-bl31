# Raspberry Pi 4 bl31
A compilable project that is meant to be used for EL3 init and rpi4 compatable bl31.
This is Raspberry Pi 4 only. I made this because real bl31 has limited RPI4 support and this is a simple replacement for it.

## Compilation
These commands are for compiling rpi4-bl31. It has support for the Raspberry Pi 4, though it doesn't have much functionality.

```
git clone https://github.com/EnpyRooters/rpi4-bl31.git
cd rpi4-bl31
make
```

## Installation
These commands are for moving it and using it after reboot and telling the GPU firmware to load our firmware.

```
sudo mv ./build/bl31.bin /boot    # This may be in /boot/firmware depending on the mount point of the boot partition
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```

Than add

```
kernel=kernel8.img   # Or where ever your kernel is
armstub=bl31.bin
```

## Usage
ONLY REBOOT IF YOU HAVE A DEVICE THAT CAN READ THE BOOT PARTITION. If you don't, you can comment out the armstub config or continue and reboot with this in mind.

```
reboot    # DANGER! YOUR PI MAY NOT BOOT DUE TO BUGS
```

#
If you want to use the SMCs, use must make sure you are using it right. this code snippet should help. This is for custom TEE or a kernel object that will use out SMCs.
YOU MUST CHANGE smc/bl31_smc.c TO YOU DEVICE MEMORY SIZE SO THIS WORKS! SAME FOR init/el3_mmu.s BECUASE THEY ARE AT DEFAULT CONFIGURED FOR 8GB OF RAM!
